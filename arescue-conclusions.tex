In this work, we performed benchmarking, to
quantify the effects of network affinity on CPU usage when communicating VMs
are colocated versus dispersed.
Next, we developed VM \textit{pair-wise} models
that can estimate ``colocated'' CPU usage, on being
input their individual dispersed-case resource usages,
and to estimate ``dispersed'' CPU
usage based on colocated-case resource usages.
For the ``colocation'' and ``dispersion'' models, we first
built models that predicted the total CPU usage
upon migration\textemdash{}these CPU models use all resource (CPU, disk, mutable
and immutable network) usage profiles as their input. However, these models
had an error of around 4\%. So, next we built enhanced models
to predict only the differential CPU usage\textemdash{}these
models use only the \textit{mutable} network traffic metrics as input,
and have maximum error within 2\%. Finally, we demonstrated the
application of \textit{pair-wise} models to predict for multi-VM
scenarios, with high accuracy.
%We tried two approaches
%of modeling and found that predicting differential CPU usage provided
%better accuracy\textemdash{}with maximum error within 2\% absolute CPU usage.
%We also demonstrated that simple 
This proves that CPU usage prediction models built
on the scale of two VMs can be used for prediction in multi-VM
scenarios as well.


%In this work, we have empirically profiled different kinds of workloads and
%presented the effect of colocation on the DomU and Dom0 CPU utilization for Xen.
%We also presented models for estimation of the CPU usage when dispersed VMs
%are moved to colocated placement and vice-versa. 
%Experiments showed the 90 percentile error to
%be less than 3\% absolute of CPU utilization, over both synthetic and real
%application workloads.
%
%Though our empirical study is based on Xen virtual machine monitor, the approach
%is general enough to be applicable to other virtualization technologies as 
%well. For example, in case of KVM where there is no concept of a privileged
%domain, we expect that the affinity related benefits will be more 
%prominently visible in the VM's CPU usage itself, and the above-mentioned modeling will 
%prove valuable for CPU usage prediction on colocation/dispersal.
%
%In our work, we have made the assumption of homogeneity of PMs,
%both in terms of capacity as well as the architecture. 
%The assumption of homogeneity of capacity can be withdrawn provided the higher 
%level consolidation or placement algorithm accounts for the differing capacities
%and makes placement decisions accordingly. However, the assumption of homogeneity
%of architecture may be non-trivial to dispense with, because on such differing
%architectures, the Dom0 and DomU CPU usage may also
%be different and not directly mapped~\cite{profiling-and-modeling}. It would be of 
%interest to
%develop mappings from one architecture to another, so that our model can
%be extended to apply to machines with heterogeneous architectures as well.
