In this chapter, we present a brief background review to cover 
the entire thesis scope. We present the basics of cloud computing, 
usage of virtualization to provide Infrastructure as a Service cloud
computing, as well as the basic mechanisms of network and disk
I/O virtualization. 
% Add the basics of I/O virtualization here, and talk about how the 
% 2 parts of the thesis apply to various aspects of this virtualization
% framework.

In this chapter, we presented a brief background review of the area of
cloud computing via virtualization, toward the scope of this thesis.
Specifically, the discussion of network 
I/O virtualization\index{I/O virtualization} is relevant
to the first component of this thesis 
while the discussion on disk I/O virtualization corresponds to 
the second component.
%addressed in Chapters~\ref{chap:thesis-drive} and \ref{chap:thesis-architecting}).
In the rest of this thesis, we present more detailed literature review 
and background details within each chapter as well, where appropriate.

%The rest of this thesis is organized as follows. In 
%Chapter~\ref{chap:thesis-arescue}, we present work
%related to building affinity-aware CPU estimation\index{Estimation} models 
%for migrating VMs and their hosts. In Chapter~\ref{chap:thesis-drive},
%we present our I/O reduction system called DRIVE\index{DRIVE} which
%improves the efficiency of host cache using deduplication-based
%I/O redirection. For further evaluation of DRIVE, we 
%performed a detailed literature survey comprising over 100+
%publications and 350+ datasets. So, in 
%Chapter~\ref{chap:thesis-architecting},
%we present the findings of our survey, 
%which shows that there are no realistic I/O workload datasets 
%or benchmarks available that captures content representation.
%In Chapter~\ref{chap:thesis-open-directions}, we present
%some open directions and future work for this thesis,
%and Chapter~\ref{chap:thesis-conclusions} concludes.
