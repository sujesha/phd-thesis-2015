In the evaluation section for DRIVE system, we briefly mentioned the custom 
simulator that
we built to perform the quantitative analysis of IODEDUP system's efficiency,
as well as to evaluate the performance of the DRIVE system in comparison
with the Vanilla and IODEDUP systems. In this Appendix, we describe the
design and implementation of the simulator, called \texttt{SimReplay},
in more detail.

The main requirement from the simulator is that it capture the functionality of
the Vanilla, IODEDUP and DRIVE systems and demonstrate the effect of
each of these I/O access mechanisms on the cache efficiency and read
access performance. 
We have built the simulator to be modular so that it could be used to
develop and test new I/O deduplicate \& redirection strategies as well.

\section{High-level functioning and requirements}
The simulator basically accepts virtual disk requests from multiple VMs
hosted on a single physical machine, and simulates its I/O execution
on the physical machine. The I/O execution in the standard case is referred 
to as Vanilla, while the augmented execution scenario presented
in \cite{iodedup} is referred to as IODEDUP. A third execution 
scenario in this simulator is our system called DRIVE.
Since the simulation is of virtual disk requests sent by VMs, an input 
mapping needs to specify which virtual disk block of a VM maps to which
corresponding physical disk block on the physical host's storage.
Two main components of the simulator are the simulation of two 
caches on the physical host: 
(i)~a block-based (LRU) cache and (ii)~a content-based (ARC) cache, both
of configurable sizes and using write-through policy. 
Additionally, the physical host's disk or storage also needs to be simulated. 

Fig. \ref{fig:simreplay-requirements} depicts the functioning 
of the custom simulator.
As shown, a virtual disk request is mapped from the virtual address space to
the host physical address space, and then looked-up in host's block-cache.
In case of Vanilla flow, the requests flow from the block-cache straight
to the host storage. On the other hand, in case of IODEDUP flow, 
metadata is looked up for every request that is not satisfied by the
block-cache, and content is searched in the content-cache, before hitting
the host storage. In case of DRIVE flow, the requests are redirected
within the virtual machine address space itself, so that the flow path
within the physical machine address space remains unchanged (i.e., same
as Vanilla path on physical machine).

The input to the simulator is a single trace file which contains multiple
disk read/write requests. 
Each request in the trace should contain information regarding
(i)~whether it is a read or write request,
(ii)~block number to be read or written,
(iii)~data to be read or written, and its size.
The output from the simulator involves the collection of metrics like
number of cache-hits and cache-misses incurred over the execution of
all requests in the trace file.
Next, we present the high-level and low-level design descriptions 
for the custom simulator. Finally, we present details regarding the
implemented input options and demonstrate the usage of the simulator.
