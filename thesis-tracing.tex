In this section, we describe the block request tracing tools that we have
developed as part of our effort to capture traces for evaluation.
Initially, we contacted the authors of \cite{iodedup} 
regarding the block request tracing tools developed by them. They were
kind enough to allow us access to the source code of the kernel module,
called \texttt{collect.ko},
which could generate traces in a \textit{similar} format as
described at \cite{iodedup-online} (though not exactly the same format
as at \cite{iodedup-online}).
However, the output of \texttt{collect.ko} was in terms of the MD5 hash
of the content, whereas we wished to dump the entire content as-is, 
so that it could be used with other fingerprinting mechanisms as
well, example Rabin hashing~\cite{rabin}.
Moreover, the \texttt{collect.ko} kernel module used the mode of
\textit{relay channels}\cite{relayfs} to write trace records into the 
\texttt{debugfs}\cite{debugfs} filesystem, but the userspace tools to siphon 
the traces from the \texttt{debugfs} filesystem into persistent storage
were missing. 

The above issues motivated us to build our own toolkit which 
included kernel modules to dump content 
into \texttt{debugfs} filesystem, as well as a generic userspace tool
that runs in parallel and collects the \texttt{debugfs} filesystem traces
into output files. We also incorporated the functionality of 
communication across the kernel module and userspace tool such that
removal of the kernel module would signal the userspace tool and wait
for a handshake before exiting gracefully. 
Moreover, since the content to be dumped in the traces was binary in 
nature and could consist of any arbitrary characters, parsing of the
output traces became a significantly non-trivial task compared to the 
parsing of finite-sized records, as done for traces at \cite{iodedup-online}.
To enable correct parsing of every record, we devised our own trace 
record format as well.
In the rest of this section,
we first provide a brief background of the basic features used 
in the toolkit implementation, and then describe details of the
various tools implemented.
